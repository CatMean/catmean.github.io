							      <p>I designed a mobile app with my team over the course of 3 months. Our app gathered retail coupon offers and deals from local, national and chain retailers in the neighborhood. There are a lot of “deal” apps currently on the market such as Shopular, Honey, RetailMeNot, Groupon and more. Our Goal was to create a single-stop, multi-function way for any user to easily and instantly redeem coupons and offers. Our vision was to help users save money or stretch their spending dollars quickly and easily. We also wanted to encourage supporting the businesses in their own communities..</p>
									 <p><strong>USER SURVEYS</strong><br/>
We interviewed a range of users, created personas &amp; extreme users including small businesses who post their offers on platforms such as facebook and instagram along with large chain retailers. These were a few of the sample questions: <br/>• Which app do you currently use for deals and offers? <br/>• What features do you use frequently? <br/>• How do you figure you are getting the right value for your money?<br/>
										 <strong>PAIN POINTS</strong><br/>
We readily identified some of our users main complaints, including this sampling:
<br/>• How do I save money? I don’t want to clip coupons
<br/>• How can I get the lowest price? I forgot the coupon at home<br/>
<strong>CUSTOMER JOURNEY MAPPING</strong><br/>
As we researched functionality, we found that most of the existing apps already had many of the features our users desired and we opted to improve upon those existing apps by adding the features that they were missing. By getting great ideas from users about what we felt could be implemented, we improved their experiences.<br/>
										 <strong>A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION</strong><br/>
Because of the fast paced, immersive nature of the class and my frustration with the team’s focus on specific functions and colors, I used the same UX artifacts to design my own version of the app, which paralleled the group version only slightly in function but massively in tone. It worked to our favor in future discussions and decisions: in the end both of our prototypes basically mirrored what we all wanted to achieve functionally but differed in the source of design decisions. Given a long enough timeline, I feel the two would have eventually evolved into something very similar. </p>
									<p>After researching our competition and user buying habits, we enhanced our own research with market trends and consumer behaviors. We stripped out the gimmicks and wasted time such as waiting for rebates. By displaying each of these coupons and rebates cleanly in our app, we made it quick and easy for our users to save money. We presented the team's version of our app, but discussed the differences in our slides, and the experience of designing my own prototype along with the team's was hugely beneficial.</p>
