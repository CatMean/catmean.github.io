										<h1>Asset Bank Case Study - internal corporate site</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								  <p>After being hired as a hybrid graphic designer and digital asset manager, I became the admin for the company’s online image hosting portal. The Asset Bank was a little used semi-public website with limited to no search functionality. Very few field teams / employees knew of it, and it’s main utilization was by select Marketing Staff and some select customers, since it was the only access to the company’s vast library of product images. It was the only method for internally sharing their high resolution images.</p>
									 <p><strong>USER SURVEYS</strong><br/>
The Graphic Designers shared the same office space as the Marketing team, so it was relatively easy to conduct user interviews with many of them. I quickly discovered that many users used different approaches and for different purposes. The more users and complaints I observed, the more I realized that the Asset Bank could potentially be a huge and flexible source of information and truth to the company employees, as well as a useful sales tool.<br/>
<strong>JOURNEY MAPPING SAMPLES</strong><br/>
• Customers - needed a way to quickly send batches of images to *their* customers<br/>
										 • Marketing Teams - needed to find images using common technologies, materials or colors for proposals quickly<br/>
• Field representatives - needed to quickly be able to show potential clients beautiful examples of specific room types<br/>
<strong>PAIN POINTS</strong><br/>
• A difficult interface made downloading and understanding image types difficult and confusing.<br/>
• Many users had no knowledge of the vast and time-saving functionalities of the site.<br/>
• Lack of Metadata made it nearly impossible to search the site.</p>
									<p>Because of budget and technological limitations, the interface itself was only customizable within the platform’s established constraints so I first designed a friendly and quick User’s Guide and installed it on the home page to help users with downloading and understanding image sizes and file types. As the business expanded, the need for custom permissions grew so I customized the registration page to allow for multiple access points. I entered metadata in each image to allow for searching, as well as utilized the site’s synonym feature to allow for alternate taxonomy. I was also able to expedite batch uploads and metadata extraction to allow for faster dissemination once new assets were acquired.</p>
									<p>In then end, the Asset Bank’s user growth went from 1-2 users per month to 3-5 users per day. Word has spread, and employees as well as customers are now finding it invaluable as a resource because of it’s availability on weekends and outside the company network.</p>
