							      An artist friend had an upcoming exhibition but never commissioned a website, mainly due to cost and complexity. She knew that her first public showing would garner interest and wanted a simple overview site. In desperation, she contacted me 2 days before her show. I’m a graphic designer by trade, but had never worked with any kind of web technologies before. I needed to get a basic landing site up quickly and for free or relatively low cost.</p>
									<p>Initial research revealed that my usual design software would not be able to create a site, and that while I had access to web building software, the learning curve would be too difficult to master in the limited time. Having worked with plenty of templates in the graphic design industry and being familiar with HTML code, I was pleased to discover that many designers created ready templates (free with credit) that I could quickly modify in an additional free app, TextWrangler. I simply needed to eliminate some the template functionality since it would be a static, not a dynamic site, choosing to focus on her contact information and her most impressive works while presenting her as a fun, spirited creative. I also quickly learned what I could about the back / hosting end to discover solutions. My husband hosts his own site and was able to help me deploy to his AWS account.</p>
									<p>Hosting on our servers, and later finding better domain names which redirect, I am able to maintain and update my friend’s site while presenting just a high level overview of her work. The cost is minimal, about $2 a month. Using HTML bootstrap templates, and having access to quality images and testimonials, I was able to quickly create and deploy a site for Anna Meyer before her exhibition. This way, anyone who viewed her art during the show could either search or go directly to her website to see more of her works, or contact her for commissions.</p>
